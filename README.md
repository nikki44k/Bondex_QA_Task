## About the Task

The QA task involved testing the Bondex web application available at [https://bondex.app](https://bondex.app). The main objectives were to:

- Perform exploratory testing covering critical user flows (sign-up, wallet connect, token claiming, invite links)
- Identify, document, and report bugs with clear repro steps and evidence
- Draft manual test cases targeting core functionalities
- (Optional) Automate a key test case using Playwright/Cypress
