## Additional Functional and UX Observations

### 🔹 1. Missing "+ Add Bio" Button
- Page: https://bondex.app/talent/profile
- Issue: The “About” section is missing the "+ Add Bio" button, unlike other profile fields (e.g., experience, education). Inconsistent UI affects usability.

### 🔹 2. AI Job Match Button Redirect Bug
- Page: https://bondex.app/
- Flow: Click “Get Started” in "Bondex AI > AI Job Match"
- Issue: Redirects user to **Sign-Up** page, even if already logged in. After login, it lands on “Jobs for You” tab instead of “AI Matching.”
- Impact: Breaks user flow; potential abandonment point.

These UX flaws, while not blocking, reduce usability and trust and should be fixed in the next UI pass.
