# Additional Functional and UX Observations - QA Evaluation

## 1. Missing "+ Add Bio" Button in Profile “About” Section

**Bug Quality:**  
- **Accuracy:** Clearly identifies a missing UI element (`+ Add Bio` button) in the "About" field of the profile page, compared to other profile sections.  
- **Reproducibility:** Easy to reproduce by navigating to `https://bondex.app/talent/profile` and inspecting the “About” field.  
- **Severity Judgment:** Medium severity — affects usability and UI consistency but does not block functionality.  
- **Evidence:** Recommend including screenshots contrasting the “About” section with other sections that have the button.

**Testing Depth:**  
- Covers a critical user journey of profile editing.  
- Could be extended to test multiple browsers, user roles, and devices to ensure the button is consistently missing.  
- Verify if any CSS or conditional logic hides the button unintentionally.

**Communication:**  
- Concise and well-structured description highlighting the inconsistency and its impact on usability.  
- Actionable for developers and UI/UX designers.

## 2. AI Job Match Button Redirect Bug

**Bug Quality:**  
- **Accuracy:** Precisely documents an incorrect redirect when clicking “Get Started” in “AI Job Match,” even if the user is logged in.  
- **Reproducibility:** Clear reproduction steps — clicking the button leads to sign-up page, then redirects to “Jobs for You” instead of “AI Matching.”  
- **Severity Judgment:** High-medium severity — breaks a key user flow, risking user frustration and drop-off.  
- **Evidence:** Screenshots or screen recordings of the redirect flow, login page, and incorrect landing page are recommended.

**Testing Depth:**  
- Tests critical user navigation flows, including logged-in and logged-out states.  
- Should also test for edge cases like session expiry, different user roles, and correct tab landing post-login.

**Communication:**  
- Clear articulation of the bug and its impact on the user experience.  
- Suggests prioritizing fix in upcoming UI iteration.
