Summary:
My test strategy focused on covering critical user journeys, particularly the wallet connection flow and the app download experience, as these directly impact user onboarding and engagement. I began with exploratory testing to identify functional and UX issues, capturing detailed bug reports with clear reproduction steps, severity, and evidence. Following that, I designed reusable manual test cases targeting core features and edge scenarios, ensuring coverage of both happy paths and known problem areas. Given more time, I would expand tests to include user story for this, and greater regression, functional, performance testing and device compatibility, automated end-to-end flows, and deeper validation. Throughout, I prioritized concise communication and actionable feedback to support efficient issue resolution and maintainable test design.
