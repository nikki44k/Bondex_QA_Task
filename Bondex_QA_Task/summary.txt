Summary:

My QA test strategy focused on verifying Bondexâ€™s core user flows: profile setup, wallet connection, token access, and app download functionality.
I began with an exploratory approach to identify critical issues blocking user success, such as wallet authentication failures and broken app store links. 
My bug reporting emphasizes clear reproduction steps, expected vs. actual results, and severity levels. I also prepared a reusable mini test suite for regression coverage. 
If given more time, I would explore deeper edge cases like rejected MetaMask connections, add mobile cross-browser validation, and implement Playwright automation to continuously test login and wallet features.
